International founders choose Prolify because we simplify the entire US business setup and keep you compliant every step of the way.",

    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "Why should I form an LLC and open a US business bank account?",
    answer:
      "Forming an LLC protects your personal assets from business liabilities—it creates a legal separation between you and your company. A US business bank account keeps your personal and business finances separate, making tax filing cleaner, building business credit easier, and giving your company credibility with US clients and partners.",
  },
  {
